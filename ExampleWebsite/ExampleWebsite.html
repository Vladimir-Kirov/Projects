                    and nearly 90,000 in the agglomeration.</p>

					<p><strong> By plane </strong><br>   
					Geneva Cointrin International Airport is the closest major airport to Montreux, and serves direct flights from most major European hubs, as well as a few cities in Canada and the United States, North Africa, and the Middle East. From Geneva, it's a little more than an hour by car, and less than an hour by train. The Railway Station in Geneva is connected to Geneva International Airport. From the arrivals hall turn left (inside the building) and you will walk through a shopping mall where the railway platforms are one floor below.</p>
					<p><strong> By train </strong><br>
					Montreux is served by direct rail services from Geneva, Lausanne, and Brig-Glis, and is easily accessible via rail connection from almost anywhere else in Switzerland. See the SBB site [3] for timetable info.</p>
